Two years ago I was a very different person. I was in the infamous life of the ones who sell their souls to bay area companies. Yes, one of those that types keys in a keyboard and gets a six figure salary. Well imagine having that in a third world country. I was rich, and dumb. I spent a lot of money on dumb shit. Well, turns out one of the items I've got back then __somehow__ brought me a genuine new experience two years later, that made me reflect about tech and, more specifically, game consoles.

stops here

Earlier this week my sister, who does movie school, wanted a few weeb things from me to use as props in a short movie.

- OS is cute, it's like your little home, it shows about who you are since you can express yourself there
- fun, casual tho it doesn't mean no complexity in games
- game preview animations are just :ok_hand:
- two screens well used
- simplicity in menus, options and games is key
- apps interact with each other (miis, footsteps, etc). Feels more like an integrated experience
  - I guess that's pretty nintendo considering stuff like amiibos
- goofy cameras & snd screen
  - it's not meant to be useful bro, it's meant to be fun & exciting!!! C'MON U DON'T WANT A PHOTO OF UR CAT IN 3D?!??!
- P E R S O N A L I Z A T I O N
- new apps -> GIFTS c u t e

downsides:

- yeah the thing is ordinary plastic
- the 3D is fun but just awful after a few minutes
- sometimes they don't use the buttons or make the UIs the best, but they're not enfuriating in any way

wii:

- felt like a downgrade over DSs OS

switch:

- great games, soulless OS
- caught in the hype of the handheld mode, barely used it three times for 30 minutes each (all in an airport/airplane)
- perhaps too big for handheld + OS is uninviting
- close to xbox/ps4 than to ds

ps4 OS is pretty, but soulless, and the personalization capabilities are just blend. There's something about Nintendo's personalization that is not more useful or more detailed, it just feels more comfy man.

I've used (maybe not relevant to the discussion):

- Windows XP, 7 & 10
- Ubuntu, Arch Linux
- MacOS

and in phones: iOS & Android
